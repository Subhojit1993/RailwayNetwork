# Shortest Path Detection for intra-zone communication in Indian Railway Network

The Project was completed keeping in mind about the Graph theory Application using JAVA8 and 
based on the Indian Railway Network which is clearly showing the path from Source to Destination.  

# Three main things of the project: 

1. Determining Shortest Path. 
2. Blocking the route. 
3. Finding the alternate path.
